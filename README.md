golang:
✔ Gunakan pointer untuk method yang mengubah struct.
✔ Pakai interface untuk abstraction dan testing.
✔ Selalu return error, bukan boolean atau string.
✔ Gunakan context.Context untuk handle request lifecycle.
✔ Gunakan log, bukan fmt.Println().
✔ Gunakan goroutines dan channel untuk concurrency.

# Golang Backend Best Practices

## 📌 Introduction
Golang is a powerful and efficient language for backend development, offering simplicity, concurrency, and robustness. This guide outlines best practices to build scalable and maintainable backend applications in Go.

---

## 🏗️ Project Structure
A well-structured project improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.
```
/project-root
│── cmd/              # Main application entry points
│── internal/         # Private application and business logic
│── pkg/             # Publicly accessible packages
│── api/             # API handlers and routes
│── config/          # Configuration management
│── database/        # Database connection and migrations
│── models/          # Structs and database models
│── repository/      # Data access layer
│── services/        # Business logic
│── handlers/        # HTTP handlers
│── tests/           # Unit and integration tests
│── main.go          # Entry point of the application
│── go.mod           # Dependency management
```

---

## ⚡ Best Practices

### 1️⃣ Use Struct and Interface for Abstraction
- Define **structs** for data models and **interfaces** for contracts.
- Helps with dependency injection and testing.
```go
// Define User model
 type User struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
}

// Define UserRepository interface
 type UserRepository interface {
    FindByID(id int) (*User, error)
    Save(user *User) error
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Error Handling: Always Return `error`
- Avoid returning boolean or string errors.
```go
func (repo *UserRepo) Save(user *User) error {
    _, err := repo.DB.Exec("INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES ($1, $2)", user.ID, user.Name)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to save user: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Use `context.Context` for Request Lifecycle Management
- Prevent memory leaks and long-running queries.
```go
func (repo *UserRepo) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id int) (*User, error) {
    query := "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=$1"
    row := repo.DB.QueryRowContext(ctx, query, id)
    
    var user User
    err := row.Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &user, nil
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Logging: Use `log` Package Instead of `fmt.Println()`
```go
import "log"
log.Println("User created successfully")
log.Printf("User ID: %d, Name: %s", user.ID, user.Name)
```

---

### 5️⃣ Concurrency: Use Goroutines and Channels for Performance
```go
func FetchUsersConcurrently() {
    users := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    ch := make(chan string)

    for _, id := range users {
        go func(userID int) {
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
            ch <- fmt.Sprintf("User %d fetched", userID)
        }(id)
    }

    for i := 0; i < len(users); i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-ch)
    }
}
```

---

## 🔥 Key Takeaways
✔ **Use struct and interface for separation of concerns.**  
✔ **Always return `error` instead of boolean or string.**  
✔ **Use `context.Context` for request management.**  
✔ **Use `log` for proper logging.**  
✔ **Utilize Goroutines and Channels for concurrency.**

# Golang Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Best Practices

## 📌 Introduction
Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design (DDD) help to create scalable, maintainable, and testable backend applications in Go. This guide provides best practices to structure your Go projects effectively.

---

## 🏗️ Clean Architecture Folder Structure
A well-structured project enhances readability and maintainability.
```
/project-root
│── cmd/              # Main application entry points
│── internal/         # Private application logic
│   ├── domain/       # Business entities and domain logic
│   ├── usecase/      # Application logic and business rules
│   ├── repository/   # Data persistence logic
│   ├── handler/      # HTTP handlers (controllers)
│── infrastructure/   # External dependencies (DB, API clients, etc.)
│── config/           # Configuration management
│── main.go          # Entry point of the application
│── go.mod           # Dependency management
```

---

## ⚡ Best Practices for Clean Architecture & DDD

### 1️⃣ Use Pointers for Methods That Modify Structs
- Allows modification of struct data inside methods without copying the object.
```go
type User struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
}

func (u *User) UpdateName(newName string) {
    u.Name = newName
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Use Interfaces for Abstraction & Testing
- Decouples implementations and makes testing easier.
```go
type UserRepository interface {
    FindByID(id int) (*User, error)
    Save(user *User) error
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Always Return `error`, Not Boolean or String
- Makes error handling explicit and traceable.
```go
func (repo *UserRepo) Save(user *User) error {
    _, err := repo.DB.Exec("INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES ($1, $2)", user.ID, user.Name)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to save user: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Use `context.Context` to Handle Request Lifecycle
- Ensures graceful shutdown and prevents memory leaks.
```go
func (repo *UserRepo) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id int) (*User, error) {
    query := "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=$1"
    row := repo.DB.QueryRowContext(ctx, query, id)
    
    var user User
    err := row.Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &user, nil
}
```

---

### 5️⃣ Use `log` Instead of `fmt.Println()`
```go
import "log"
log.Println("User created successfully")
log.Printf("User ID: %d, Name: %s", user.ID, user.Name)
```

---

### 6️⃣ Use Goroutines & Channels for Concurrency
- Helps in handling multiple tasks efficiently.
```go
func FetchUsersConcurrently() {
    users := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    ch := make(chan string)

    for _, id := range users {
        go func(userID int) {
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
            ch <- fmt.Sprintf("User %d fetched", userID)
        }(id)
    }

    for i := 0; i < len(users); i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-ch)
    }
}
```

---

## 🔥 Key Takeaways
✔ **Use pointers for struct methods that modify data.**  
✔ **Use interfaces for abstraction and easy testing.**  
✔ **Always return `error` instead of boolean or string.**  
✔ **Use `context.Context` to handle request lifecycle.**  
✔ **Use `log` for logging, avoid `fmt.Println()`.**  
✔ **Utilize Goroutines and Channels for concurrency.**
